As the creator, I need the page to link to my social and GitHub pages, so that visitors can follow me, and I can build my audience.
As a visitor, I want the viewport properly sized, so that content fits all the size I have available.

As a visitor, I want the primary nav to be responsive with a menu, so that I can get around using any device.
